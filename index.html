            <h4>Overall Airbnb data in New York City</h4>
            <p>The symbol map and bar chart above show the overview data of Airbnb in New York City, with the map shows where all the Airbnb are located in the city based on latitude and longtitude. 
              The city is divided into 5 boroughs: Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island.
              When select either a borough from the legend or from the bar chart, the visualisation will highlight
              the chosen option, as well as showing the information relevant to the area. Furthermore, when hover over the point on the map, 
              information about that particular location will be shown as well. From the graphs above, Manhattan seems to have the most Airbnb listed, 
              while Queens has the highest average price for an Airbnb.

          <h4>When do all these locations got built?</h4>
          <p>The line chart below shows when all the locations in the data got built. 
            According to our data, some of the places that are listed on Airbnb are have been constructed in 2003, before the company got founded.

          <h4>Comparisons of Airbnb listings in New York City based on services</h4>
            <p>The four pie charts below compares Airbnb listings throughout New York City
              based on four categories: Host identity verified, Instant book, Type of accommodations and 
              Cancellation policy. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="pure-u-1-1">

        </div>
        <div class="pure-u-1-1">
          <p>
            As seen from the charts, Airbnb host identity verification in New York City are divided into two: verified and unconfirmed.
            The numbers are roughly around the same, with verified numbers are only higher than unconfirmed numbers by a small amount.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly to host identity verification numbers, the numbers between instant and not instant book are also roughly the same;
            not instant booking are only higher than instant booking by a small numbers. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Majority of the listings are for home or apartment, as opposed to private or shared room, 
            with shared room having the least listings. This could be because a lot of guests are often more comfortable with renting 
            a private room, home or apartment, as well as with many hosts not comrtable with sharing room for short term stays. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The cancellation policy of these listings are divided into three: strict, moderate and 
            flexible. As seen from the numbers, most listings have strict cancellation policy, follow by moderate and then flexible.
